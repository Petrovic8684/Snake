# Snake

This is a simple Snake clone written in C using the SDL2 framework. The project is compiled and ready to use as is for Windows, though can be recompiled to run on Linux operating systems ( first replace the sdl files with their Linux alternatives, then recomplie. Make sure to use the 32bit dev versions of [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases), [SDL2_ttf](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_ttf/releases), [SDL2_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer/releases)).
